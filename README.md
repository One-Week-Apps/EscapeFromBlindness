# The Game
Escape From Blindness proposes the first Voice Over based Escape Room app experience!  
Help Jack the explorer to reach the exit of the cavern he is trapped in.
 
• Dozens of unique levels which use the full features of Voice Over to reproduce a blind phone user experience.  
• Don't try to fool the game, you cannot progress through the various levels without Voice Over enabled!
